# 🚢 Titanic Data Analysis Using Matplotlib and Seaborn

This project explores the famous **Titanic dataset** using **Python, Matplotlib, and Seaborn**.  
The goal is to perform **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** and visualize key patterns in passenger demographics, travel classes, fares, and survival rates.

## 📊 Key Analyses

- **Survival Count** – Overall survivors vs non-survivors  
- **Survival by Gender** – Female passengers had higher survival chances  
- **Survival by Passenger Class** – First-class passengers survived more often than third-class  
- **Age Distribution** – Many passengers were young adults  
- **Survival by Age** – Children had better chances of survival compared to adults  
- **Fare Distribution** – Wealthier passengers generally had higher survival rates  
- **Correlation Heatmap** – Shows relationships between numerical features
